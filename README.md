Have You ever wonder about transient and simple gathering statistics of using your application and storing them on remote server? Now it's possible with UsageStatistics! From now Your efforts will be focused on tasks considering customer's behaviour!

Different standalone java tools need to gather statistics of their usage (for example that given feature was used, that user clicked on something, saved some file, etc.). Eclipse Usage Data Collector (UDC) provides such functionality but has no official API and it is tightly connected with Eclipse RCP, so the more general Java framework for usage statistic collection is needed.
